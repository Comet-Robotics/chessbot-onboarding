## Introduction
#### Welcome to the ChessBots Onboarding Application!

The goal of this application is to introduce prospective members to the code structure and tools that are used when working on the ChessBots project.
This repo is a simplified version of the ChessBots codebase. As you work on completing the application, you will be introduced to many concepts required for working on the main project.
These concepts include but aren't limited to:
- Programming Fundamentals

If you want to research more about these concepts before or as you work on the application, you can look at the resources in our [Resource Library](https://github.com/Comet-Robotics/chessbot-onboarding/wiki/Resource-Library).
All of the links in this README are accessible any time via the Wiki.
